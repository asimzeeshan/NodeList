This is a PHP web application I wrote to keep track all my VPS and dedicated servers.  It utilized some library written by myself. This application is storing records in CSV format. It's recommended to use by only yourself.



This application is maintained during my free time. Feel free to create pull request or [report issue](https://github.com/seikan/NodeList/issues) and I will have look whenever possible.



### Requirements

- PHP 7.2 and above.
- Apache / Nginx web server.
